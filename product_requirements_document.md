# Product Requirements Document: Funnel Flow

## Feature Name
**Funnel Flow: AI-Powered Marketing Funnel Analysis & Optimization Platform**

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Market Challenge
Marketing professionals and business owners struggle to identify conversion bottlenecks in their marketing funnels, leading to:

- **Revenue Loss**: Up to 96% of website visitors leave without converting, with most businesses unable to pinpoint why
- **Inefficient A/B Testing**: Manual funnel analysis is time-consuming and often misses critical optimization opportunities
- **Generic Solutions**: Most funnel analysis tools provide generic recommendations that don't account for specific target audiences
- **Copy Creation Bottleneck**: Creating compelling marketing copy that aligns with funnel improvements requires specialized skills and significant time investment
- **Lack of Actionable Insights**: Existing analytics tools show what happened but not what to do about it

### Business Impact
- **Time Cost**: Manual funnel analysis takes 2-4 hours per campaign
- **Opportunity Cost**: Delayed optimization means continued revenue loss during analysis periods
- **Resource Allocation**: Teams spend more time analyzing than implementing improvements
- **Inconsistent Results**: Human analysis varies in quality and focus areas
